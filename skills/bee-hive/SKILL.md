Bootstrap meta-skill. Load this first in bee repos. It verifies onboarding, reads runtime state, routes to the next skill, and protects the four human approval gates.

For the full routing table, state bootstrap, resume logic, chaining contracts, and communication standards, open `references/routing-and-contracts.md`. For the full pipeline, open `references/go-mode.md`.

## Onboarding

1. Run `node --version`. Missing or below 18 → stop; bee requires Node.js 18+.
2. From this skill directory, run:
   ```bash
   node scripts/onboard_bee.mjs --repo-root <repo-root> --json
   ```
3. Inspect the result:
   - `status: "up_to_date"` → continue.
   - `status: "changes_needed"` → summarize the plan to the user, ask for approval, and only then re-run with `--apply`. Never apply silently. Never replace an existing compact prompt or AGENTS.md content outside the BEE markers without explicit consent.
   - `--repo-hooks` only when the user asks for repo-local hook wiring.
   - `--claude-md` only when plugin hooks are unavailable and the user wants the CLAUDE.md `@AGENTS.md` import fallback.

If onboarding is not complete, do not continue into the rest of the bee workflow.

## Session Scout

After onboarding succeeds, run the read-only scout on every session start and after compaction:

```bash
node .bee/bin/bee_status.mjs --json
```

Orient on: onboarding health, phase, mode, feature, gate states, cell counts, active reservations, staleness warnings, and `recommended_next`.

**HANDOFF:** if `.bee/HANDOFF.json` exists, present its phase, feature, cells in flight, and next action to the user and **wait for confirmation. Never auto-resume.**

Then read `docs/history/learnings/critical-patterns.md` and surface recent active decisions (`node .bee/bin/bee_decisions.mjs active --recent 3`).

## Routing

| Request | Route |
|---|---|
| Vague or new feature | `bee-exploring` |
| Research task, clear scope | `bee-planning` |
| Small clear fix | `bee-planning` (tiny/small mode) |
| Review request | `bee-reviewing` |
| Clean up / debt / audit | `bee-grooming` |
| Capture learnings | `bee-compounding` |
| Improve bee itself | `bee-writing-skills` |
| `/go` or full pipeline | go mode (`references/go-mode.md`) |
| Resume | surface HANDOFF, wait |

**Surface scope earlier:** if the request already contains concrete acceptance criteria *and* references to existing patterns, offer: "Found clear requirements. Jump straight to planning, or explore alternatives first?" On approval, route to planning with a one-paragraph scoping synthesis in place of CONTEXT.md gray-area work — the decisions still get D-IDs.

When in doubt, invoke `bee-exploring` first.

## Modes and Lanes (the mode gate)

Classification is **mechanical**. Count these risk flags:

> auth · authorization · data model · audit/security · external systems · public contracts · cross-platform · existing covered behavior · weak proof around the area · multi-domain

| Mode | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `tiny` | 0–1 flags, ≤2 files, no API/data change, one direct task |
| `spike` | one yes/no proof decides whether the plan is real |
| `small` | 0–1 flags, ≤3 files, no gray areas |
| `standard` | 2–3 flags, or story-sized behavior |
| `high-risk` | 4+ flags **or any hard-gate flag** (auth, authorization, data loss, audit/security, external provider, validation removal) |

Use the least workflow that honestly protects the work. A tiny fix wearing epic ceremony is a red flag; a hard-gate change routed as `small` is a worse one.

## The Four Gates

Never skipped, never batched, never self-approved — including go mode and headless mode:

- **Gate 1:** "Decisions locked. Approve CONTEXT.md before planning?"
- **Gate 2:** "Work shape is ready. Approve before current-work preparation?"
- **Gate 3:** "Feasibility validated. Approve execution?"
- **Gate 4:** P1 > 0 → "P1 findings block merge. Fix before proceeding?" ; P1 = 0 → "Review complete. Approve merge?"

Optional at Gates 2–4: a cross-model second opinion. Agreement → mention it. Disagreement → quote both positions to the user. Never auto-resolve.

## Priority Rules (hive law)

1. P1 review findings always block.
2. Context budget always applies; at ~65%, write `.bee/HANDOFF.json` and pause.
3. `CONTEXT.md` is the source of truth; locked decisions are cited, never reinterpreted.
4. Gate 3 is the critical execution approval; no source-editing execution before it.
5. A failed reality gate or a NO spike halts the pipeline and returns to planning.
6. Never skip validating — in tiny mode it collapses to a 2-minute reality check, it does not disappear.
7. `docs/history/learnings/critical-patterns.md` and recent active decisions are mandatory context before planning or executing.
8. Evidence before claims: any "done/passing/fixed" statement requires fresh command output in the same message.

## Runtime Files

- `.bee/onboarding.json` — onboarding status and managed versions
- `.bee/state.json` — phase, mode, feature, approved gates, workers
- `.bee/config.json` — hook toggles, lanes, capabilities
- `.bee/HANDOFF.json` — pause/resume data
- `.bee/reservations.json` — file reservations
- `.bee/decisions.jsonl` / `.bee/backlog.jsonl` — decision log / friction items
- `.bee/cells/<id>.json` — one cell per file
- `.bee/bin/` — vendored helpers (`bee_status`, `bee_cells`, `bee_reservations`, `bee_decisions`) + `lib/`
- `docs/history/<feature>/CONTEXT.md` — locked decisions, source of truth
- `docs/history/learnings/critical-patterns.md` — mandatory pre-work reading

## Hook Response Protocol

Hooks block or inject; the agent responds by contract:

- `@@BEE_PRIVACY@@ … @@END@@` marker on a read → route through AskUserQuestion with the file and question from the marker. Never work around the block.
- Gate-guard block on a write → do **not** retry the write; surface the Gate 3 question to the user ("Feasibility validated. Approve execution?").
- Reservation block → the worker returns `[BLOCKED]` with the conflict; the orchestrator fixes reservations or cell scope.

## Headless

With `mode:headless`: never ask blocking questions. Perform onboarding checks and routing only when unambiguous; defer every ambiguity (stale onboarding needing `--apply`, HANDOFF present, unclear route) into an `Outstanding Questions` section of a structured terminal report. The four gates are NEVER self-approved in any mode.

## Red Flags

- jumping from exploring to swarming · code before CONTEXT.md exists · skipping validating · ignoring locked decisions · workers self-selecting cells · capping without verification · commits without cell ids · continuing past open P1s · reservation leaks · stale state.json after a phase transition · resuming without surfacing HANDOFF.json · plausibility language ("should work") accepted as evidence · a tiny fix wearing epic ceremony · a hard-gate change routed below high-risk · session history pasted into a worker dispatch

Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.

Session oriented and route chosen. Invoke bee-<selected-skill> skill.
