# Pinned pre-migration sources (okf-migration-f2, F8)

These files are **verbatim committed copies** of each migrated area's source as
it stood immediately before the commit that replaced it with a D37 pointer
stub. They are not documentation and must never be edited: each one is
content-addressed by the `blob_sha` recorded in `scripts/okf_migrate.mjs`'s
`PIN_REGISTRY`, and `okf_migrate` verifies that hash with `git hash-object`
before it will use the file.

**Why they exist.** The coverage gate derives its ground truth by extracting
anchors from the pinned blob, normally reached through
`git rev-parse <commit>:<path>`. That fails outright in a `--depth 1` clone —
the object simply is not there — and a gate that *skips* when it cannot read
its own ground truth is worse than no gate. So the gate falls back to the copy
here, verifies its hash against `blob_sha`, and refuses (exit 1) when neither
the git object nor a matching copy is available. A copy that has drifted from
its pinned hash is refused too.

| `onboarding.md` | `a06f59d` (f2-8 close, the commit before f2-9 stubbed it) | `c78ca9b…` | `ba-nine-section` | 58 (0 B / 28 R — `R20b` included / 15 E / 15 P), 20 unparsed blocks |
| `hook-runtime.md` | `ab8cf6e` (f2-9, the commit before f2-10 stubbed it) — **REPAIRED**, see below | `a8907ce…` | `ba-nine-section` | 81 (22 B / 24 R — `R8a`, `R8b`, `R14a` included / 17 E / 18 P), 8 unparsed blocks |
| `worktree-parallelism.md` | `687ac59` (f2-10, the commit before f2-11 stubbed it) | `df2f441…` | `narrative-sections` | 10 (`S-` + slugified `## ` heading), 2 unparsed preamble blocks |

**One of these sources needed a scheme nobody had written yet.**
`worktree-parallelism.md` is the only area of the eleven with **no numbered anchors at all**
— no `B*`/`R*`/`E*`/`P*` id anywhere in its 225 lines, and none of the four anchor-bearing
nine-section headings. Every earlier "shapeless" verdict in this migration turned out to be a
blind reader (`decision-memory`'s nine rules were written `- **R1 — …**` and the f2-4 widening
found them); this one is the real thing, and `ba-nine-section` derives 0 anchors AND 0 unparsed
blocks from it. F9 forbids forcing it into that shape and D10 forbids inventing ids the source
never had, so a **third scheme** was added: `narrative-sections`, where the source's own `## `
headings ARE the anchors, slugified mechanically from the heading text. A `###` subheading is
not an anchor (its prose travels with the section containing it), a source with zero `## `
headings is REFUSED rather than passed 0/0, and two headings that slugify alike are refused
outright — the duplicate-id hazard `hook-runtime.md` had to be repaired to escape cannot arise
under this scheme. Adding it was a strict no-op: all nine pre-existing pins still derive their
exact counts, asserted in `scripts/test_okf_pins.mjs` section 28.

**One of these copies is not a byte copy of any commit, and says so.**
`hook-runtime.md` shipped the rule id `R14` **twice** — the gate-bypass
block-verdict rule and the write-guard command-shape rule, two genuinely
different rules. Anchors are keyed by id, so the first one's text was silently
overwritten by the second's: unmeasurable by the fidelity floor forever, and
invisible to a set-equality check as the pair's second member. A source in that
state cannot be migrated honestly and neither rule may be dropped or merged to
fix it, so the source was **repaired before the pin was captured**: the second
occurrence in document order was renumbered `R14a`, one token on one line.
Those bytes therefore exist in no commit's tree, and the pin declares that
explicitly — `repaired_from` names the provenance blob at
`ab8cf6e:docs/specs/hook-runtime.md` (still asserted exactly, so drifting
provenance stays as loud as a drifting pin) and `repair_reason` states why. For
this one file the copy here is not a shallow-clone fallback but the pin's only
content address.

Re-derive and re-assert every pin at any time:
