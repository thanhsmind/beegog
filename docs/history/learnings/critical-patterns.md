# Critical Patterns

Mandatory pre-planning / pre-execution context for this repository.
bee-compounding appends hard-won patterns here; keep it short and current.

## [20260708] Windows Git Bash /tmp is invisible to node
**Category:** failure
**Feature:** harness09
**Tags:** [windows, paths, environment]

Shell redirection into `/tmp` works under Git Bash, but handing that `/tmp/...` string to
a node API fails — node cannot resolve MSYS paths. Pipe the file through stdin
(`cat file | node -e ...`) or use a Windows-style absolute path (the session scratchpad).

## [20260708] Verify strings are authored, not just read — two traps
**Category:** failure
**Feature:** harness10
**Tags:** [verify-strings, shell, validation, prose-cells]

A cell's `verify` command must be executed once before it reaches a worker, not reviewed as prose.
Two traps, both survived static review this feature:
1. **Metacharacter regex:** `grep -q '['` is an invalid regex and aborts the `&&` chain. Dry-run any
   verify containing regex/glob metachars (`[ * ? |`) in the target shell, or use `grep -F` for literals.
2. **Grep-for-prose gaming:** a verify that greps for an invented multi-word token rewards embedding that
   token verbatim into prose. Grep a **stable heading** the section needs anyway, never an invented phrase.

## [20260710] A boundary that lists field names will leak the field you forgot
**Category:** failure
**Feature:** evolving-loop
**Tags:** [security, allowlist, trust-boundary]

The same defect survived three rounds: a validator covered `title`, then `title`+`layer`+`source`,
and each time the next unremembered field was the next hole (`first_seen` rode in on
`Date.parse("Jan 1 2020 (payload)")` — lenient date parsers treat parenthesised text as a comment).
A list of field NAMES cannot make forgetting a field fail. Map each field to its validator and
**derive the field list from the map**, so an unspecced field is a red test, not a vulnerability.
Then write the table-driven test that feeds a payload into *every* field.

## [20260710] A frozen assertion can encode the defect it guards — the worker must stop, not rewrite
**Category:** process
**Feature:** evolving-loop
**Tags:** [testing, frozen-assertions, review]

Twice, a "frozen" assertion asserted the exact vulnerability under repair — one written by the very
cell tasked with building that boundary, one pinning the defective syntax itself. 93 then 104 green
assertions proved conformance to a wrong spec, not safety. Both were found only because a worker hit
them while fixing a bug and returned `[BLOCKED]` quoting the assertion instead of "correcting" it.
**Keep that escape hatch.** A worker never unfreezes an assertion; the planner does, narrowly, with a
logged decision (`c45d0fb3`, `b8fe5c81`). Corollary: a drift guard that greps a module's own source
pins syntax, not behavior — and pinned syntax can be the bug.

## [20260710] Evidence is checkpointed to disk per step, never held in context until the end
**Category:** failure
**Feature:** evolving-loop
**Tags:** [iron-law, workers, context]

An Iron Law worker edited `SKILL.md` and died before writing its RED pressure-test report; the edit
was reverted, because an unrecorded RED phase is not a RED phase and reconstructing it from the
worker's summary would be fabricating evidence. Its successor checkpointed each scenario to disk as
it finished, was interrupted mid-run, and lost nothing. Write each scenario, each proof, each
observation as it lands. Note also that `grep '## RED'` passes on a `touch`, and one commit holding
RED+GREEN proves no ordering — commit RED separately.

## [20260710] Never release another agent's reservations on a stall signal
**Category:** failure
**Feature:** evolving-loop
**Tags:** [swarming, reservations, orchestrator]

A "stalled/killed" notification was trusted; the orchestrator released a live worker's reservations,
reset its claimed cell, and dispatched a duplicate. Nothing corrupted — the first worker finished and
the second returned `[NOOP]` — but the reservation guard was defeated by the orchestrator, not by a
race. Before declaring a worker dead, check for progress on disk over an interval. The lock did its
job; the person with the key opened the door.

## [20260710] A NUL byte in a source file makes grep silently match nothing
**Category:** failure
**Feature:** evolving-loop
**Tags:** [tooling, grep, verification]

`sortKey` joins fields with a NUL separator — a legitimate technique. Side effect: `grep`/`rg` treat
the whole file as **binary and print nothing, not even a zero count**. In a repo whose drift guards
are grep-over-source, this reads as "the symbol is gone". It briefly convinced an orchestrator that a
landed fix had vanished. If a grep over a source file returns empty rather than `0`, check for
control bytes before believing it.

## [20260710] A plan that names a source must name the reader that can open it
**Category:** process
**Feature:** evolving-loop
**Tags:** [planning, cells, scope]

A cell mandated markdown frontmatter as a collection source, restricted content reads to the JSON-only
wrappers, and forbade bare filesystem reads in the module — with a two-file scope. No reader existed
for the source it required. The worker had to widen a shared helper outside its declared scope to do
the honest thing rather than game the security check. When a plan names a source, it names the reader
that can open it, or it grants the scope to build one.
