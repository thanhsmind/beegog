## [20260708] Windows Git Bash /tmp is invisible to node
**Category:** failure
**Feature:** harness09
**Tags:** [windows, paths, environment]

Shell redirection into `/tmp` works under Git Bash, but handing that `/tmp/...` string to
a node API fails — node cannot resolve MSYS paths. Pipe the file through stdin
(`cat file | node -e ...`) or use a Windows-style absolute path (the session scratchpad).
