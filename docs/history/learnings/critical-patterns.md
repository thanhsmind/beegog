# Critical Patterns

Mandatory pre-planning / pre-execution context for this repository.
bee-compounding appends hard-won patterns here; keep it short and current.

## [20260708] Windows Git Bash /tmp is invisible to node
**Category:** failure
**Feature:** harness09
**Tags:** [windows, paths, environment]

Shell redirection into `/tmp` works under Git Bash, but handing that `/tmp/...` string to
a node API fails — node cannot resolve MSYS paths. Pipe the file through stdin
(`cat file | node -e ...`) or use a Windows-style absolute path (the session scratchpad).

## [20260708] Verify strings are authored, not just read — two traps
**Category:** failure
**Feature:** harness10
**Tags:** [verify-strings, shell, validation, prose-cells]

A cell's `verify` command must be executed once before it reaches a worker, not reviewed as prose.
Two traps, both survived static review this feature:
1. **Metacharacter regex:** `grep -q '['` is an invalid regex and aborts the `&&` chain. Dry-run any
   verify containing regex/glob metachars (`[ * ? |`) in the target shell, or use `grep -F` for literals.
2. **Grep-for-prose gaming:** a verify that greps for an invented multi-word token rewards embedding that
   token verbatim into prose. Grep a **stable heading** the section needs anyway, never an invented phrase.
