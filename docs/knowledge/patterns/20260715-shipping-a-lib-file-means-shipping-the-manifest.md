# Shipping a lib file means shipping the manifest: regen release-manifest inside the feature

**Any cell that adds/renames/changes a file the manifest hashes carries the regen in ITS OWN
work and both `--check`s in ITS OWN verify.** Not the slice's last cell, not the close step —
the cell that moves the guard owns it, because every cell between it and the close otherwise
caps green against a red shared baseline. **Do not memorize which roots are hashed, and do not
trust any list written here or anywhere else — `cells add` derives them from the scripts at
every write and refuses the cell if the obligation is missing** (see MECHANIZED below). Every
count ever recited for this trigger was wrong, including the ones this doc used to carry; the
current derivation reports twelve manifest roots and two ledger roots, and it will report a
different number the day a script grows one. `ledger_parity` covers strictly less than the
manifest does, so it must never stand in for it. Order matters:
`render_plugin_skill_trees.mjs` → `onboard --apply` → `release_manifest.mjs --write`, because
`onboard --apply` never renders the plugin trees and a manifest written first freezes stale
trees as authoritative with nothing going red. Same rule generalized: before capping a cell,
ask which standing repo-wide guards hash the files you touched, run their regen inside that
cell, and put their `--check` in that cell's verify.

**MECHANIZED 2026-07-23 (regen-obligation-derived, ro-1) — the recurrence log ends here.**
`cells add`/`cells update` now REFUSE a cell whose own `files` touch a hashed root unless its
own `verify` carries that guard's `--check` (and, for the manifest, unless `files` lists the
manifest path). The roots are **derived from the scripts at every write**, never hard-coded —
and that instruction was the load-bearing one, not the refusal logic. Every number anyone had
recited for this trigger was read from a summary or a window rather than from the definition:
D20 said one root (`templates/lib/`), D24 corrected it to two (`skills/**`, `hooks/**`), the
P75 brief re-asserted two, the orchestrator widened it to six from `release_manifest.mjs:130-136`
— and the derivation measures **twelve**, because `DISTRIBUTION_TOOLS`/`DISTRIBUTION_TESTS` are
hashed at `:141-142`, outside that window. A guard built on the recited six would have shipped
blind to five hashed roots. The escape hatch is `regen_obligation_ack`, a reason string, so a
skip is an act with a name in the trace. A present-but-yielding-nothing guard script throws
rather than passing silently; a repo with no `scripts/` owes nothing.

**Recurred 2026-07-19 (cnt-3):** the cell regenerated rendered plugin trees, deferred the
manifest regen to "the slice-closing cell", and its own cell verify ran neither check — it
capped green while the shared baseline sat red for every concurrent session until a fix-first
cell (cnt-6) repaired it. Prose alone did not hold under a multi-session checkout;
mechanization (manifest check derived into the verify of any cell whose files hit rendered
trees or `lib/`) is now the recorded fix direction, not a nice-to-have.

**Recurred 2026-07-20 (msh-1) — THIRD instance, new layer:** the cell added a lib file and
regenerated the manifest, but the committed plugin skill trees were never re-rendered
(`render_plugin_skill_trees.mjs`); red surfaced only at the feature-close full chain and cost a
fix-first cell (msh-8). The derived-artifact set for a `templates/lib/` touch is now known to be
THREE-deep: `.bee/bin` mirror + rendered plugin trees + release manifest. Until the mechanization
lands (backlog), any lib-touching cell's verify carries all three regen/checks explicitly.

**Recurred 2026-07-22 (okf-switchover-f3 close-out) — FOURTH instance, and the derived set is now
FOUR deep.** The session rewired one citation inside `templates/lib/inject.mjs` and ended with the
repo RED on four suites: lib-mirror parity, release manifest, plugin distribution, and a
preamble-contract suite. The new layer beyond the known three is the **onboarding managed-hash
ledger** — `.bee/onboarding.json` records a hash per managed `.bee/bin/**` file, so re-syncing the
mirror is not enough; self-onboard must re-run or `ledger_parity --check` stays red. Full set for
one `templates/lib/` touch: **mirror copy → plugin tree render → manifest write → self-onboard**.

The deeper cause is not the count. The edit was made OUTSIDE a tracked cell, AFTER that cell's
cap-time verify had already gone green. **A cap-time verify is evidence about the tree as it stood
at that moment, and it expires the instant anything else is edited** — run the full chain again
before ending the session, with no exception for "it was just a citation" or "the cell already
passed". The next session opened on the red baseline and paid the repair.

**Recurred 2026-07-23 (compaction-hardening D24) — FIFTH instance, and the trigger itself was
scoped wrong.** The earlier recorded trigger was "any file under `templates/lib/` or `.bee/bin/lib/`
changes" — but `scripts/release_manifest.mjs` was measured to actually hash `skills/**` and
`hooks/**` in full, including the rendered plugin/skill projection trees themselves, not only the
shared lib directory. A cell touching only `hooks/**` moves `release_manifest --check` and does
**not** move `ledger_parity --check` (which covers only `.bee/bin/lib` and the shared helpers) — so
two cells in the same feature each carried exactly the check that stays green for a hooks-only
change and omitted the one that actually goes red. The ordering matters too: the plugin/skill tree
render must run **before** the manifest write, because the onboarding apply step never renders
those trees on its own — a manifest written first freezes stale trees as authoritative with nothing
going red to say so. Fix direction, generalized again: before scoping a regen trigger to "the lib
directory," check what the manifest script's own hash list actually covers — a scope written from
assumption can pass green while hiding the exact bug it exists to catch.
